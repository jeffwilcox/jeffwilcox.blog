# Source of jeffwilcox.[com|dev|blog]

Next.js static site. Previously Jekyll. And WordPress. Inspired by [pilcrow](https://pilcrowonpaper.com/) and [vercel portfolio](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit).

# Identity

In 2018 the primary hostname changed from `jeff.wilcox.name` to `jeffwilcox.blog` and `jeffwilcox.com`. And I guess `jeffwilcox.dev` at some point, too.
