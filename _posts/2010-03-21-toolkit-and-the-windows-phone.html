<p>Are you looking for WrapPanel for your Windows Phone application? Look no further. The Silverlight Toolkit has several controls that work pretty well on the Windows Phone.</p>  <p><a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="WrapPanel" border="0" alt="WrapPanel" src="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/WrapPanel.png" width="454" height="338" /></a> </p>  <p>I wanted to provide my own informal look at how it’s working with Silverlight for Windows Phone today.</p>  <p>Note that this information is only current as of today, 3/21, when used with the MIX-related CTP of the tools and emulator, and the November 2009 Silverlight Toolkit. A lot could change, and this is <strong>not exhaustive</strong>.</p>  <p>I’m also including some controls that are found in the Silverlight SDK today. I present these in order of how much I have used the components while building apps.</p>  <h3>WrapPanel and DockPanel</h3>  <p>Found in the Silverlight Toolkit, System.Windows.Controls.Toolkit.dll (SWC.Toolkit).</p>  <p>Work great.</p>  <p>If you just need the WrapPanel, and don’t want to include the entire toolkit assembly, you can just paste these source files into your application project instead (license: <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/ms-pl.html">Ms-PL</a>):</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/network/Show?projectName=Silverlight&amp;changeSetId=35261#636618">OrientedSize.cs</a></li>    <li><a href="http://silverlight.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/network/Show?projectName=Silverlight&amp;changeSetId=35261#638862">WrapPanel.cs</a></li> </ul>  <h3>Charting and Data Visualization</h3>  <p>There is a known issue with LINQ that prevents the controls today from working perfectly. A small, targeted fix has been made in the charting codebase and a future release will work well on the device.</p>  <p>Re-templating and styling the control is very important, and required, for working on the phone in an acceptable manner. I hope to share any decent templates I can come up with.</p>  <h3>HeaderedItemsControl, HeaderedContentControl</h3>  <p>Work great. Split between System.Windows.Controls (SWC) and SWC.Toolkit.</p>  <h3>TreeView</h3>  <p>SWC. Functional; requires massive re-templating and styling. Font sizes are much too small, and the theme and visuals do not appear code-name “Metro” compatible.</p>  <h3>AutoCompleteBox</h3>  <p>Found in the System.Windows.Controls.Input SDK library of the Silverlight 3 SDK.</p>  <p>Works OK, not ready for general development use.</p>  <p>Drop-down appears well. Major features all work. However, touching an entry in the drop down only performs selection. A second touch is required to verify the choice, effectively requiring a double-tap in use.</p>  <h3>Calendar, DatePicker</h3>  <p>SWC. Limited functionality, too small visually. Not designed for touch – not enough space to reliably click on a date. Require massive re-templating. Do not resemble the same experience as the date picker built into the Windows Phone operating system.</p>  <h3>GridSplitter</h3>  <p>Works, but may pose difficult to use on a device: requires much larger padding and custom templates to make the touch area visible and useful.</p>  <h3>Not yet checked</h3>  <p>DataGrid, DataPager, ChildWindow, Label, NumericUpDown, DomainUpDown, DataForm, Rating, TimePicker, TimeUpDown, GlobalCalendar, TransitioningContentControl, TreeMap, BusyIndicator, Viewbox, Expander, Accordion, drag and drop features, and many more.</p>  <p>We’re also still developing a story for the toolkit’s phone story moving forward. As there is a lot of momentum around the phone in the company, it’s very likely that some set of phone tools, samples, and toolkits come out.</p>  <p>Hope this helps.</p>
