I’ve received a number of emails and questions from developers about the next release of the Silverlight Toolkit and wanted to take a moment to address the lack of a March release.  <p>Although we had previously talked about a March 2010 release to coincide with the Silverlight 4 RC at MIX, we have decided not to ship an interim release for the RC, since the final release of Silverlight 4 is coming next month.</p>  <p>This is a good thing for developers, the time we save by not releasing goes toward a better release overall when Silverlight 4 is final.</p><p>In the meantime, the release of the toolkit in November, for Silverlight 3, still works great on Silverlight 4 RC.</p>
