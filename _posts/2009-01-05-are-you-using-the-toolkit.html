<p>Are you using the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Silverlight/">Silverlight Toolkit</a> on your site, or in an app? It'd be great if you could post a little bit about the control(s) you're using and the URL to your app, if you'd like to share. Just comment on this post!</p>  <p>The <a href="http://silverlight.net/Showcase/">Silverlight Showcase</a> is a great way to share your work with the community at large... so consider submitting an app there as well.</p>  <p>However, I'd like to highlight the unique and useful applications people are using the toolkit for. And, yeah, if you just borrowed the open source and built some even cooler controls with it... that'd be nice to hear about, too.</p>  <p><strong>I'll follow up in a few weeks with coverage of what I find.</strong> Thanks!</p>  <p>And, if you'd like to <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Silverlight/WorkItem/List.aspx">provide suggestions</a>, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Silverlight/WorkItem/List.aspx">open issues and bugs</a>, there are appropriate places for that to happen, too. Same goes for <a href="http://silverlight.net/forums/35.aspx">getting support</a>.</p>  <h3>Download the December 2008 release of the Silverlight Toolkit</h3>  <p><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/Silverlight-Toolkit.png" /></p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=Silverlight&amp;ReleaseId=19172">Binaries, samples and documentation</a> (10 MB) </li>    <li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=Silverlight&amp;ReleaseId=19172">Binaries, samples, documentation, unit tests and complete source code</a> (11 MB) </li>    <li><a href="http://silverlight.net/samples/sl2/toolkitcontrolsamples/run/default.html">Explore the updated, combined sample explorer</a></li>    <li><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SilverlightToolkitTeamMembersBlogFeeds">Subscribe to the syndicated feed of all team members</a> (RSS)</li> </ul>
