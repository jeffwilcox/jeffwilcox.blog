<p>I’ve received a lot of people asking around on Twitter and other places for the emulator theme that I use with the Windows Phone developer tools. I created these one slow evening at home, sharing on my blog now. Use at your own risk, it’s unofficial to replace this sort of thing.</p>  <h3>What it looks like</h3>  <p>Pretty basic, looks like a Focus phone with your favorite American carrier! If that scares you, there’s always a little Photoshop magic possible to blend away the brand.</p>  <p><a href="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/JeffsEmulatorTheme.zip"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="london_gallery2" border="0" alt="london_gallery2" src="http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/london_gallery2.png" width="430" height="837" /></a></p>  <h3>Download the bits</h3>  <p><strong>489 KB Zip:</strong> <a href="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/JeffsEmulatorTheme.zip">JeffsEmulatorTheme.zip</a></p>  <h3>How to install</h3>  <p>Simple process.</p>  <ul>   <li>Extract the Zip</li>    <li>Overwrite (will require elevation) the files in your Windows Phone Emulator folder (on a 64-bit machine, this is “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft XDE\1.0\”)</li>    <li>Re-launch the emulator</li> </ul>  <p>Only side effect with this one is that the emulator “toolbar” is another 20px or so to the right than the old one, and overall the skin is larger – but it looks great, is nice for screenshots, and if you have a large screen it’s the way to go!</p>  <p>Hope you enjoy it,   <br />Jeff</p>
