<p>A few weeks ago I sat down, built a simple app using the DataVisualization control assembly (charting) from the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Silverlight/">Silverlight Toolkit December 2008</a> release, and then started gold plating it with a few additional features and tricks. I was pleasantly surprised that retemplating is the key to customizing most of the charting experience, just as with all other WPF and Silverlight controls.</p>  <p>The default data point tooltips are useful - they show the formatted dependent value, which is just what you'd expect: &quot;show me the exact value.&quot; But, for me, since I'm already bound to rich business objects on the client side, I'd much rather have is &quot;show me the details!&quot; Although this feels lengthy and involved, once I figured it out, this only took about 5 minutes to accomplish. This guide should make it easy enough for you to use when you'd like to.</p>  <p>In my application, here's what the default experience looks like when I hover the house over a point:</p>  <p><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/DefaultTooltip.png" /> </p>  <p>Informative; here's the associated tool tip binding that is in the default template for the LineDataPoint (see also, the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Silverlight/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=19172">source code download</a> for the Silverlight Toolkit):</p>  <p><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/DefaultLineDataPointTemplate.png" /> </p>  <p>But for my application, I wanted to pull more of the associated business object data and place it in the tooltip. This actually only took retemplating of the LineDataPoint to bind to a custom property of type 'object' on my business object, and then updating my business object to output the necessary UI elements to appear inside the tooltip.</p>  <p><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/AdvancedTooltip.png" /> </p>  <p>Here's the custom binding, defined in my page's resources, with the key name CustomLineDataPointTemplate:</p>  <p><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/CustomLineDataPointTemplate.png" /> </p>  <p>Then, I need to make sure that the custom template is used for all the line data points. So, I provide a style palette that binds all of its points to the custom keyed template. I copied most of the color palette, including the nice-looking colors and gradients, straight from the default template's source. For each color, I bound to the custom template for the line data point:</p>  <p><img src="http://media.jeff.wilcox.name/blog/view/CustomStylePalette.png" /> </p>  <p>Now, for the business object. If you're using data from a web service, you will probably want to create a wrapper data object and then bind to that - it'll open up the ability to extend the class with this bound method to return the content for the tooltip.</p>  <ul>   <li>Add the method named in your custom binding, in my case, 'DataPointTooltipText'</li>    <li>The method signature returns an object</li>    <li>Return the tooltip content - something as simple as a TextBlock, or a Grid or other sophisticated UI tree.</li> </ul>  <p>My example will just return a TextBlock, with a few Run and LineBreak inlines placed:</p>  <div style="padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px" id="scid:887EC618-8FBE-49a5-A908-2339AF2EC720:300ef2d8-d637-4119-82eb-c0a3f11f45a6" class="wlWriterSmartContent"><pre class="c-sharp" name="code">public object DataPointTooltipText
{
    get
    {
        TextBlock tb = new TextBlock();
        tb.Inlines.Add(new Run { Text = basics });
        tb.Inlines.Add(new LineBreak());
        tb.Inlines.Add(new Run { Text = "XAP: " + ZipSizeText + " KB" });
        tb.Inlines.Add(new LineBreak());
        tb.Inlines.Add(new Run { Text = "Uncompressed: " + SizeText + " KB" });
        tb.Inlines.Add(new LineBreak());
        tb.Inlines.Add(new Run { Text = "Changeset: " + Changeset });
        tb.Inlines.Add(new LineBreak());
        tb.Inlines.Add(new Run { Text = Assembly, Foreground = GrayBrush });

        if (IsKnownReleaseWeek)
        {
            tb.Inlines.Add(new LineBreak());
            tb.Inlines.Add(new Run { Text = "Official release week", FontWeight = FontWeights.Bold });
        }
        return tb;
    }
}</pre></div>

<p>Hope this helps.
