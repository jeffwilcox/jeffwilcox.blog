<p>Hi, it's the giving time of the year... One thing we would love to do on the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Silverlight/">Silverlight Toolkit</a> is <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=10303">embed Silverlight content</a> in our CodePlex site, to help everyone better interact with and understand the capabilities of Silverlight and controls.</p>  <p>It'd be nice for us to offer samples, control examples, and other Silverlight content on the CodePlex site. Does that mean embedded Silverlight &lt;object /&gt; tags or iframes? Not sure, but it would be nice to have some option here.</p>  <p>I think this would be a nice feature for many more projects than just ours.</p>  <p>One of the fun things about CodePlex is that it is all about the entire community, and we (&quot;Microsoft&quot;) don't hold any special strings here. So, I'm asking for your assistance this holiday season!</p>  <p><strong>If you're a CodePlex user, it would rock if you'd just spend a minute and vote for the 'Silverlight hosting' feature request on the site at </strong><a title="http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=10303" href="http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=10303"><strong>http://www.codeplex.com/CodePlex/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=10303</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>  <p>Thanks for your assistance, and happy holidays,   <br />- Jeff</p>
