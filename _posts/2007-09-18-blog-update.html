<P>I'm looking to provide more frequent technical blog postings, with a little personal insight from time-to-time, to make things a little more interesting here.&nbsp; If you’re looking for a complete Silverlight reference or article, MSDN or the Silverlight Forums on Silverlight.net are great places to hang out. </P>



<P>So get ready for a “more human” blog—I sincerely apologize that <EM>this</EM> post has substantially little content or value.&nbsp; But what I do offer is a promise to change the format of my postings going forward… the general feedback I’ve received from customers, friends, and Microsoft employees: “Good stuff,” “Interesting read,” “Great article on debugging,” etc.&nbsp; Yet I often find myself in conversations with people about so much more—debating the latest and greatest in tech, chatting about iPhones and Adobe, that I’d like to offer some of those thoughts here as well.</P>



<P>All great things for sure.&nbsp; Expect a lot more interesting Silverlight content, with an occasional post unrelated to my daily responsibilities at work, and yeah, still some interesting articles too!&nbsp; Don't worry, I'll keep my Big Ten football comments off of this site.</P>



<P>Some of the things I’ve been working on and want to share in the coming months:</P>



<UL>

<LI>Simple, useful, and sometimes sexy proof-of-concept managed controls for Silverlight v1.1 CTPs</LI>



<LI>Experiences with a lot of bleeding-edge products, including Expression Blend 2 betas, Adobe CS3 Web Premium, Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 beta 2</LI>



<LI>Interesting managed HTML DOM bridge concepts and techniques for Silverlight</LI>

</UL>



<P>Let me know what you think!</P>
