<p>MIX was a blast this year. The excitement sure was palpable around the Windows Phone, and it’s always just quite amplified by the Las Vegas energy and the strong, passionate community that we have.</p>  <p>My Windows Phone app performance talk is now online, so check that out if you weren’t able to attend. I’ll be sharing the components I talked about pretty soon.</p>  <p>This year I decided to frame the discussion a little differently: we’ve talked about raw graphics performance, but for most apps, that’s not what developers are interested in touching. We’re all building list-based apps and those need to be best of breed.</p>  <p>The message I’m delivering is 3-fold:</p>  <ul>   <li>We’re doing work in ‘Mango’ (the next release of the Windows Phone) to improve performance by fixing bugs, optimizing, moving touch to its own thread, etc. Plus we’ve got that working set shrinking down (sweet!) </li>    <li>You need to be doing work to optimize and simplify your apps. Reducing layout cost and the number of elements will give you the biggest bang for the buck. </li>    <li>Perception of performance is as important as raw performance numbers. Consider what you can do here. </li> </ul>  <p>You can get the <a href="http://files.ch9.ms/mix/2011/ppt/DVC01.pptx">PowerPoint slide deck here</a> and the talk is online at <a title="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/DVC01" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/DVC01">http://channel9.msdn.com/events/MIX/MIX11/DVC01</a>.</p> <object type="application/x-silverlight-2" data="data:application/x-silverlight-2," width="685" height="388"><param name="minRuntimeVersion" value="4.0.50401.0"/><param name="source" value="http://channel9.msdn.com/scripts/Channel9.xap?v=1.5"/><param name="initParams" value="mediaurl=http://files.ch9.ms/mix/2011/wmv/DVC01.wmv,thumbnail=http://files.ch9.ms/mix/2011/thumbs/DVC01_lg.jpg,deliverymethod=,autoplay=false,entryid=3403256beeb34172a5059ea700ea77e4"/></object><p>Let me know what you think, Jeff.</p>
