Since [my 2019 post about my journey to bring EV charging to our condo tower in Seattle](/2019/11/evcondo),
the popularity of electric cars has accelerated, there's a lot more choice in electric cars, and everything
has only gotten more expensive for the next phase of our project, if that ever happens.

With the benefit of hindsight as we round out December 2024, with the benefit of hindsight, I wanted to
cover the following:

- Project updates and commentary
- New generation of wall chargers
- Washington State right-to-charge law

I am still incredibly proud of the progress in the face of what is an uphill battle at condos across the
country, but one reflection I have is that we should have put a time limit on charging circuit installations
to force adoption or share rights sooner.

# Project check-in

To recap the project: our Seattle condo building was constructed in the early 2000's, interest in EVs
amplified in 2010, a Level 2 community charger was installed in 2016, and in 2019 we launched a
program to allow interested owners to purchase shared infrastructure and the right to install
circuits to their parking space(s) at their own cost (no condo association or community spend).

## All approved circuits installed but one

The owners in the first phase of the program paid their portion of the infrastructure
(installation, permits, circuit breakers, transformer, sub-meters), and had a "reservation" for
the right to complete the circuit.

**We should've introduced a time restriction for reservations to convert to installations**

## Theoretical future project iteration costs continue to rise




  - Significant increase in EVs and project interest, hampered by inflation
  - Additional charger installations by owners


# 3rd-generation Tesla Wall Connectors

For a short period, Tesla was also offering the wall connectors with a choice of either 8.5 feet or 24 feet (2.6m or 7.3m) cable. We installed both,
though prefer the shorter cable as long as you're able to regularly park so that the rear driver's side is adjacent to the Wall Connector.
