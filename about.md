# Hi.

I'm a software developer "and whatever it takes" at Microsoft.

I've been at MSFT since I graduated from the University of Michigan and have had unique opportunities at Microsoft to help work on shipping several V1 products (including Windows Phone and Silverlight) through to maturity.

Today I run a development team of 7 that ships awesome open source on GitHub for Windows Azure by building OS X and Linux command line tooling, SDKs for Node.js, Java, PHP, and Python, and more. We make it possible to use Windows Azure services like storage, compute, etc. from any language on any platform.

I am also the developer of 4th &amp; Mayor, the top-rated social application on the Windows Phone Store.
