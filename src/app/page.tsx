            I work on what I love: building great developer tools and experiences for developers, by developers. 
            The self-service GitHub tools I built at Microsoft have scaled the number of engineers working in 
            the open on GitHub from 2,000 to over 70,000.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            In past software engineering and engineering manager roles at Microsoft I&apos;ve worked on
            making our Azure cloud work great on all operating systems and with many great open source 
            languages. I also have worked on server software, client and phone platforms, and
            plenty of ambitious failed products.

            I built the now-discontinued app <a target="_new" href="https://4thandmayor.com">4th &amp; Mayor</a>, which reached the #1 top-rated social app on the Windows Phone Store regularly from 2011-2014. The app launched in 2011 and had over 100,000 daily active users and a 300k+ installed base at its peak.

          <p className="mt-2">
            The app was a third-party Foursquare app, and the name was inspired from city living, maps, and intersections. The backend was written in Node.js & ran on AWS before migrating to Azure.

            As a software architect on the Microsoft Azure team, I got to define our early open source strategy, leading a team of engineers to deliver cross-platform Azure command line tools as well as the family of Azure SDK REST libraries for languages including Node.js, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby and .NET.

          <p className="mt-2">
            Early in my career I brought my Mac to campus to work on the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit, Silverlight Toolkit, and later the Windows Phone Toolkit. Designed to be a great code-available out-of-box update for devs, each toolkit generation brought improvements to Microsoft&apos;s adoption of reference source, working in the open, and paved the path to today&apos;s approach whereby most Microsoft open source is offered under OSI-approved licenses.
